                    <p>The human infant is a native of the mother’s body. A mother provides the home for her baby to form and grow, the birth path into this world, AND she is the sole source of all nutrition needed to start life outside of the womb. YOU were beautifully and wonderfully made to do amazing things! </br>Here in Hawaii, waiu is the word for milk. A mother’s waiu is all her infant needs to begin a healthy, nutritious, and protected life. At approximately 6 months of life, the infant begins an interest in solid foods, and the provisions of mother’s milk continues until the two mutually decide to wean. Our bodies were designed to nourish and nurture our babies! So why is it not always easy, or comfortable? Why do some moms have enough milk to feed the village, and others are struggling to produce enough for one? What can dads do to help? How or why should some moms use a pump? </br>These are good questions for a Lactation Consultant...</p>

                    <p class="greenbg">Janel Aolani Takasaki, RN, BSN, IBCLC</br></br>Born and raised here in Hawaii, Janel learned about ola (health/life) in both the Hawaiian and Western models of health care. She is a Registered Nurse who obtained her Bachelors degree in Science and Nursing and started her nursing career in 1999 with the Native Hawaiian Health Care System of Oahu. After moving to a Baby Friendly hospital setting and working with the mother/baby dyad, Janel decided to specialize in breastfeeding and became an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant in 2009. Her expertise includes assisting breastfeeding families in both the hospital Labor and Delivery, Postpartum, and Neonatal Intensive Care settings as well as in the clinic and community settings. Now in Private Practice, she sees clients in the comfort of their own homes and has a Lactation Office in Kailua. This journey began with breastfeeding her own daughter Keaowena...”I was overjoyed with the birth of my daughter and the beginnings of nursing her. Then we encountered some bumps in the road. I felt like we were struggling and needed guidance, and reassurance! With the help of an IBCLC, persistence and perseverance, breastfeeding got easier and I came to enjoy not only nourishing her, but the time spent nurturing her and bonding with her. Sometimes the struggle is worth it.”</p>

                    <p>Aloha to whom it may concern,

I am a recent client of Janel Takasaki, who helped me successfully nurse my third child.

After giving birth naturally I had thought breastfeeding would be the easiest part, however, the opposite was true.  I noticed my daughter unable to nurse well and was crying often.


Two days after giving birth I went to see the Lactation specialist and again two days after that to see the lactation consultant.  While they had given me good advice, it was not the right advice for my situation.

I called Janel to ask for her help and she came over the next day and had reassured me my worries! When you are a mom and stressed about not being able to feed your child, it is so nice to be able to have someone like Janel come to your house and make you feel very comfortable.

Long story short she helped me successfully nurse my baby while also giving my baby the strength to nurse well.  She made me feel confident that babies are meant to nurse and not to give up, and she made me feel okay with calling her and taking my time.  She was very professional and knew what I needed and baby without a hesitation.

I have told my friends to call on her if they need help too.  I'm so grateful!

Mahalo,
Mele</p>
